## Requirements

- node 22

## Application routes

Routers are a core part of any
[SPA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) and angular
supports it since the old [angularjs](https://angularjs.org/) days.

## How to build

Uou can start the [development server](http://localhost:4200) with this
npm script:

```bash
npm start
```

## Noteworthy

- The angular cli does not offer any special generator for router, it'd up to
  you to properly import and use components in your router configuration.
